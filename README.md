# CSS Styling Code Along

## Objectives

1. Review linking an external CSS file.
2. Review writing selectors.
3. Styling text content.

## Introduction

In this code along exercise we will be adding style to our pages by linking an external CSS file. If you open this lab on the in-browser Learn IDE, all the files you need for following along will be available, and will automatically clone down. However, if you were following along using a personal `exceptional-realty` repository in the previous HTML lessons, you can continue from where we left
off by running the following in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty
cd exceptional-realty
```

## Steps

```
git add .
git commit -m 'add external css file and connect it to project'
